                        The symbols of your entrepreneurial journey will be the panther and the
                        eagle.

                        The panther has confidence, latent strength and flexibility, it symbolises
                        the ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions and find hidden
                        opportunities. It also symbolises the transition to a new world.
                    </Text>
                    <Text className={styles.text}>
                        The eagle represents vision, height of flight and a wide view and foresight,
                        it reminds us of the importance of strategic thinking and foresight.
                    </Text>
                    <Text className={styles.text}>
                        At our festival, these two symbols will guide you. As the panther, you will
                        learn to adapt and act decisively in difficult situations. Like the eagle,
                        you will learn to see the overall direction and strategically plan for the
                        future of your business in an overall unidirectional creative environment.

                    <Text className={styles.text}>
                        Together, these qualities will help us create a harmonious and successful
                        entrepreneurial world. Join us at this unique festival and become part of a
                        community that builds a future based on awareness and collective evolution.
